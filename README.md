# how-do-you-learn

This repository contains implementations of different machine learning algorithms, mostly in the context of robotics.

PyTorch is generally used for algorithms that are based on neural networks.

The implementation are generally done for fun, so there is no guarantee that the algorithms are bug-free or implemented in an optimal way.
